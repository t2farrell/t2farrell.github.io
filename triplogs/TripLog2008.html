        This trip log covers my 4th trip into the park. This time, we used a new (to me)
        access point and had a very early season departure, arriving about a week after
        ice out. Ice out conditions at the park in the early season can be checked <a
            href="http://www.canoelake.ca/iceout/" target="_blank">here.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        For this trip, we brought together 8 guys, 4 canoes, rain, wind, cold, and a few
        mishaps to create a tough but memorable journey. Having a large group and wanting
        to relax a little, the plan was to travel into Timberwolf Lake via Access Point
        #3 and stay there for 3 nights.&nbsp; You might notice the longer route we took
        through Misty Lake and the 130m portage, instead of doing the 765m portage... more
        on that later.

        Jay was the primary organizer of this trip by putting the group of guys together
        and got the ball rolling with the planning of food and sharing checklists of what
        to bring.
    </p>
    <p>
        Invariably, it seems that each trip triggers a shopping spree and this time was
        certainly no exception. New additions to my pack this year included: Leatherman
        Multi-tool, new pair of Motorola walkie-talkies, more rechargable batteries, LED
        headlamp, cycling gloves for paddling and a decent rain suit (not just a poncho!),
        to name a few.
    </p>
    <p>
        Many of the guys were coming from the Toronto area, and I was coming from Peterborough.&nbsp;
        We planned to meet in Hunstville on Friday night, and stay at a hotel.&nbsp; This
        would give everyone a chance to get there after work, and would give us a clean,
        dry place to do some last minute shopping and organizing before heading out in the
        morning.&nbsp; Considering the rain we got on that Friday, I am glad we were staying
        in the hotel.&nbsp; As an added bonus, the hotel provided a continental breakfast
        in the morning, but unlike most, this one included scrambled eggs and bacon!&nbsp;
        We stayed <a

        We left the hotel in Huntsville around 7:00 AM on Saturday, May 3, 2008. We headed
        North on Hwy 11 towards Access Point #3. Before we could launch our canoes, we had
        to get our camping permits and rent our canoes and other gear.

        By 8:00 AM we had arrived at the park office in Kearney and secured our camping
        permits and paid our fees. Next we headed down the road a short ways to Canoe Algonquin.
        This outfitter provides rental equipment to those that need it, including canoes.
        Another service they provide, and one we took advantage of, is the canoe drop off
        service. For an additional fee, the outfitter will deliver your rented canoe to
        the lakeside Access Point of your choice. This is a great option for us city folk
        with cars. Not having to fiddle around with tying a canoe to the roof saves time
        and effort, and was well worth the delivery fee, in my opinion. You can find more
        information here: <a href="http://www.canoealgonquin.com/" target="_blank">http://www.canoealgonquin.com/</a>

        The weather was a bit cool and things were still wet from the rain we had earlier
        that morning. We spent some time organizing and repacking things in the parking
        lot. Our rental equipment included 2 small food barrels (they were out of the big
        ones) and some other items like sleeping bags that required last minute packing.
        At this point, we took the time to synchronize the date and time on all the digital
        cameras we had in attendance. I took some ribbing for this idea, but when you get
        home and put all the pictures from several cameras together, it is nice to be able
        to sort them chronologically (especially if you are going to write a trip log!).
        Once things were stowed away we left for Access Point #3, around 8:30. Here Neiland,
        Jaff and John ponder the excitement to come.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have been into the park a few times before, but from Access Point #5 at Canoe
        Lake. This time was a new experience. It is amazing the difference that an access
        point can make. #5 is commercialized with a store and restaurant and is located
        only a couple of minutes off the highway. The drive from Canoe Algonquin to Access
        Point #3 took around 40 minutes, and lead through a series of gravel roads that
        afforded nothing to see but trees and gravel... and it was perfect. It really helped
        to foster that sense of seclusion from going into the backcountry when compared
        to the Canoe Lake entry point.
    </p>
    <p>
        In our case, the drive also provided the sight of some snow that was tucked away
        at the base of trees, or in a sheltered ditch hidden from the sun. Another reminder
        of how early in the season this trip was. It was exciting and a bit unnerving.
    </p>

        </a>
    </div>
    <p>
        Access Point #3 consists of a few simple clearings, in the middle of a forest, which
        provide for car parking, plus an unloading area maybe 100 feet from the waters edge.
        A good quality path extends from the loading area to the water where a nice dock
        awaits the beginning of your adventure. We jockied our three vehicles into the unloading
        area and got our gear down to the lake. Our rented canoes were locked to a tree
        with a cable lock, having been conveniently delivered lakeside for us by Canoe Algonquin.
        Here is the dock on Magnetawan Lake that would mark the beginning, and later the
        end of our journey.
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
        By 9:50am we were suiting up, with the canoes loaded with gear. Here some of the
        guys wait, somewhat patiently, for guys like me to finish getting organized and
        stop taking pictures.
    </p>
    <p>
        The air was a bit cool, with overcast skies. Perfect for paddling because it wasn't
        too hot nor too cold. Around 10:00am we were in the water, paddling towards our
        first portage and getting our "sea" legs. Even though I've gone on other trips before,
        there is always a small period of adjustment getting used to the canoe and the stability
        of it. The neat thing is that with every trip you take, it takes less time to get
        comfortable. Our first portage (135m) was a very short paddle up Hambone Lake. We
        almost ran through this portage, eager to get on with things.
    </p>

        </a>
    </div>
    <p>
        We were able to skip the second portage (55m) from Hambone Lake into a pond. The
        high water levels allowed us to easily navigate the creek. A pleasant surprise,
        but one that would have been better appreciated if it had come along later in what
        would turn out to be a very long day.
    </p>
    <p>
        The pond passed quickly and by 10:30am we had reached the 420m portage from the
        pond into Daisy Lake. This might be a good point to comment on the portages. Being
        early in the season, the portages were wet. Muddy in some areas, slick in others.
        Many of us wore rubber boots and in my case, I wore the same rubber boots with the
        felt liners that I wear when I go ice fishing. These are terrible for hiking in,
        but at times on the trail, I was so glad I was wearing them. If I take another early
        season trip, I think a good quality pair of waterproof hikers will be on the shopping
        list.
    </p>
    <p>
        As an aside, taking pictures of the portage signs are a great way of creating a
        timestamp of when you start and finish a portage.
    </p>

    <p>
        It took us thirty minutes to complete the portage into Daisy Lake. At this point
        we took a few minutes rest and drank some water. In addition to being wet and slippery,
        the portages through this area are fairly hilly and provide a good workout.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here Jaff looks on, as we leave the portage dock in the background. This area is
        quite low and wet. You can see the log plank path extending left from the dock towards
        higher, dryer ground.
    </p>
    <p>
        A few minutes later put us into Daisy Lake which is a good sized lake, shaped a
        bit like a crescent moon. At this point in the trip, it was beautiful, but on the
        way home, this lake seemed to go on forever. I'm not sure if being out of shape
        has anything to do with that or not, but it likely doesn't help.

    <p>
        Here Neiland is caught floating around and smiling for the camera, instead of paddling.
        Ok, well, I guess the others in the background aren't paddling either.
    </p>
    <p>
        A couple guys took the opportunity to wet a fishing line as we crossed Daisy Lake.
        At this point in the trip we were still energetic. The weather was decent for travelling
        and we were taking our time, soaking up the scenery.
    </p>
    <p>
        At 12:10pm we reached the start of the fourth portage, a short 135m from Daisy Lake
        into the Petawawa River. The rain was still holding off and we felt were were making
        decent time. The end of the portage revealed a small rapids where the lake empties
        into the river. It only took us about 15 minutes to finish this portage and set
        out on the river heading Northeast.

        to mark the start of the portage. You can see how the land slopes up in the background.
        Some hills mixed with wet ground made for some good hiking, that required a careful
        eye and a cautious step. It was very easy to slip on a muddy slope, especially when
        carrying an overloaded pack on your back. At the end of the portage, <a id="pic47Link" href="#"
            data-id="47">this pic</a> shows a few of the guys loading up the canoes,
        with a nice little rapids in the background. Jay and John launched first, and killed
        the time waiting for the rest of us by casting a line into the base of the white
        water, but nothing was hungry.

    <p>
        By 2:00pm we had completed the 450m portage on the Petawawa River and continued
        paddling Northeast towards Little Misty Lake. The river stretches out beyond <a id="pic59Link" href="#"
            data-id="59">Jaff's pose</a> and was a really nice paddle, for the
        most part. One of the benefits of going so early in the season is the complete lack
        of bugs. Normally a paddle through a narrow river like this would be brutal for
        bugs if you hit the season right, but this time it was awesome.
    </p>
    <p>
        It was around this time that things got interesting. The rain started. A sometimes
        heavy, but mostly steady fall of rain. It was kind of neat at first, but it wore
        thin after not too long. The rain would not be the only excitement along this river
        of adventure. In some shallow water, the tight curves of the river produced some
        areas of current. One of our canoes was caught snoozing, no doubt induced by the
        steady patter of rain, and was pulled sideways by the current into a log that half
        crossed the river. Now this particular log had a broken branch on the side that
        closely resembled a spear. That "spear" made its mark, punching a fist sized hole
        through the side of the canoe. Luckily, the hole was well above the waterline, so
        it only served as a wake up call and was not any kind of emergency.
    </p>
    <p>
        Given the rain, the cameras were mostly tucked away for awhile. Around 3:00pm we
        arrived at the start of the 935m portage from Little Misty Lake into Misty Lake.
        The rain let up, and allowed us to finish the portage, but the ground and everything
        else was quite wet.

        </a>
    </div>
    <p>
        By 4:00pm we had reached the end of the portage and stood on the shore of Misty
        Lake. Things couldn't have been all bad yet, as <a id="pic68Link" href="#" data-id="68">
            Bruce was still smiling
        </a>. The rain was still falling on and off and we were
        getting tired, eagerly looking forward to arriving at our campsite.
    </p>
    <p>
        With the fatigue setting in, we looked at the map. Two routes were available into
        Timberwolf Lake from Misty Lake. Behind door number one was a 765m portage. Door
        number two promised a 130m portage, and given the higher water levels, our wishful
        thinking led us to believe that we might even be able to bypass the shorter portage
        by paddling the creek. Based on this wishful thinking and a definite lack of desire
        to do another long portage we decided to paddle the long way around, down Misty
        Lake and opt for door number two.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is hard to say which way would have been better in the end. We were tired, hungry
        and wet. The hilly terrain and wet ground would have made the long portage a real
        challenge for us at this point. While crossing Misty Lake, we found some sheltered
        shoreline that <a id="pic71Link" href="#" data-id="71">harboured some ice and snow</a>.
    </p>
    <div class="imageLeft">

        </a>
    </div>
    <p>
        Around 5:30pm we arrived at the shorter portage at the far end of Misty Lake. This
        was our 7th and last portage for the day... ok, 6th if you remember we were able
        to skip one. It was good to finally reach our destination lake, but we had a ways
        left to go to find a campsite, and the youngster in me was yelling "Are we there
        yet?!?!"
    </p>
    <p>
        It was getting late, and we were now on a mission. The rain fell pretty heavy at
        times, and we headed across the lake to try to get one of the campsites on the island.
        We made landfall on the western one first, and I wanted to check out the other one.
        Even though we passed the north side of the island on our way into the lake, the
        other site was hidden by a well treed point. Jaff and I made our way around the
        rest of the island looking for the other elusive site. As we rounded the island
        and opened ourselves up the west, we caught a faceful of wind and driving rain that
        came out of nowhere. When we finally found the site, it was too small and hilly
        to fit 8 guys, so back we went.
    </p>
    <div class="imageRight">
        <a id="pic77" href="/assets/images/triplog2008/Algonquin2008(77).jpg" class="fancybox" rel="Alg2008"

        </a>
    </div>
    <p>
        This excursion cost us more time than we realized, and by the time we got back,
        the others had long since decided that the first site would become home, and had
        started putting up tarps. I don't blame them, I was exhausted.
    </p>
    <p>
        We fought the rain and the wind and managed to put together a makeshift campsite.
        It would have to do until we got more energy and some better weather. It wasn't
        until after 8:30pm that someone snapped a picture of the <a id="pic77Link" href="#" data-id="77">waterlogged
            travelers</a>.

        Sunday, May 4, 2008
    </h3>
    <p>
        We awoke to a cool, overcast morning. The night before had been cold. I bought a
        new backpackers sleeping bag rated for +7C, which was in line with the weather forecasts
        that were predicting lows of +5C. No worries I thought, a couple of degrees either
        way, I'll just wear an extra T-shirt. Well, that didn't work quite so well, considering
        the actual overnight low dipped to around 0C. It was a cold, shivery night.
    </p>
    <p>
        Without the previous urgency to set up camp in the rain before dark, I could now
        survey the campsite we had chosen. It was a good one. A nice point with exposure
        on two sides, and a short walk to the Southwest would reveal the end of the point
        and full exposure to the whole lake. Nice mature trees which were great for slinging
        ropes, especially clotheslines, which were in high demand today. The clearing around
        the firepit was large and well suited to 8 guys with gear. The site also had an
        aluminum boat in the clearing, which I assume was an MNR boat, that served nicely
        for a table and bench.

        By 1:00pm it became clear that for the most part, the order of the day would be
        to dry out. The weather was not very co-operative and the sun remained hidden, leaving
        us to toil around the fire, propping boot liners up on sticks. We had lunch, consisting
        of sausages wrapped in pemeal, wrapped in a pita, with cheese. These would be the
        bright spot of the day so far. There were many groans to be heard as this group
        of city boys got up stiff and sore after a night of sleeping on the ground, which
        was preceded by a full day of paddling and portaging. Given the long day before,
        I was content to chill out around the campsite on day 2. My rainsuit and some other
        clothes were wet, and with the overcast skies threatening more rain at any time,
        the thought of heading out across the lake and getting soaked in my last set of
        dry clothes wasn't too appealing. The temperature remained cool all day, with many
        of us content to wear full coats, toques and gloves, even at midday.

        There are some drawbacks to drying clothes by the fire, including the constant monitoring
        required, and the potential for damage if it is too close for too long. This day
        would see several scorched shoes, boot liners, and <a id="pic101Link" href="#" data-id="101">
            this poor hat
        </a> of Bruce's. Of course, Bruce would have you believe that he
        left someone else in charge of the "constant monitoring" that is required, and it
        was therefore someone elses fault that the hat suffered an unnatural end.

        A few of the guys were more adventurous than I, and decided to go try their luck
        at some fishing. Jay was rewarded for his efforts, and returned with <a id="pic99Link" href="#" data-id="99">a
            nice trout</a>, but overall they weren't that plentiful.

        In the afternoon, we decided to go for a hike around the island. It was something
        to do, and came with the added benefit of helping to keep us warm. We marched around,
        single file, taking in the natural surroundings, including a tree riddled with woodpecker
        holes, and several piles of animal droppings, from what I assume to be a deer. Our
        efforts were rewarded, as the sun made an appearance, and the cloud cover began
        to break up. It was great to see the sun, and feel the warmth. A few of us took
        the opportunity sit down, and relax, soaking up the new heat source.
    </p>
    <p>
        After some lazy relaxation and with the sun shining, the motivation was stirred
        in some others, and many of the guys went out to do some late afternoon and evening
        fishing.

        I stayed at the campsite to move my tent to a better location, wipe up some water
        and air some things out now that the sun was here to help. I wanted to readjust
        things a little bit. I wasn't happy with the tent location that we ended up with
        the night before, it was a bit low and situated downwind from the firepit.
    </p>
    <p>
        The others didn't have much luck with fishing, but they did get the chance to enjoy
        some late day sunshine out on the lake. The weather at this point of the trip might
        have been among the better days we had, being sunny and not too windy. By 7:00 PM
        I think most everyone had returned from the lake, and my tent relocation was completed.
        Dinner was underway and I was looking forward to a nice evening campfire.
    </p>
    <p>
        The chill in the evening air was unmistakable, and I was glad I brought my touque
        with me. The fire was a success and so was the belly warming beverages that made
        their way around the firepit. Our last photo was taken at around 9:30 PM. I'm not
        sure what time I crashed for the night, but I don't think I lasted much after 10.

        The dawn revealed a nice calm day. I was up around 7:30 AM and the sun was shining
        through the trees. I felt refreshed by some sleep and the promise of nice weather.
        I made my way around the campsite, taking some photos. Jay and John were up early,
        with the energy and desire to head out on a daytrip to do some fishing. Their plan
        was to head back out the way we came into Misty Lake, and travel east down the river
        in search of some good fishing. The night before, they did their best to recruit
        some other members for their expedition, however, the rest of us were still feeling
        the effects of the long paddle in and didn't want to sign up for more portages just
        yet. We were content to take a more laid back approach, with a gradual start to
        the morning, followed by setting out to explore the Timberwolf Creek that enters
        the lake from the West side. By about 8:30 AM Jay and John were on their way for
        their daytrip. By 9:30 AM the lazy campers that stayed behind (I'd like to think
        of us as energy conservationists) had sausages cooking on the open fire for breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
        Later that morning, by the time we headed across the lake to Timberwolf Creek, the
        wind had picked up and was quite strong. This made the creek a good choice for exploration
        because it gave us some cover from the wind, which made playing around on the open
        lake a little undesirable.

        Timberwolf Creek was your typical creek, with the odd beaver lodge and wetland marsh
        marking the boundaries of the open creek. Perhaps not typical of a creek in Algonquin
        Park, this one seemed to be lacking fish. Despite our afternoon efforts, the fish
        remained absent from our party. Meanwhile, in another part of the forest, Jay and
        John reached the Petawawa to Petawawa 195m portage at 12:43PM while doing their
        daytrip.

        The map showed that Timberwolf Creek was fed by a small lake, Larry Lake. Jaff and
        I decided to be explorers and attempted to travel up the creek to see Larry. As
        we navigated through the creek, it kept getting narrower, until in places it was
        barely a paddle length across. At 12:30 PM we reached the end of the road, as <a id="pic195Link" href="#"
            data-id="195">seen here</a> just beyond the end of
        Jaff's paddle, where the creek withered to a width and depth that we didn't feel
        like fighting with. The <a id="pic198Link" href="#" data-id="198">view the other way</a>

        We paddled backwards down the creek until we found an area in which we could turn
        the canoe around. We headed back out at a leisurely pace, taking the time to cast
        a line in here and there along the way, but still without any luck. The others were
        not as adventurous as we were, and had already started heading out the creek and
        back towards home. We reconnected with some of the guys near the mouth of the creek.
        Some chit-chat and fishing later, we headed back to the campsite.

        The late afternoon and early evening brought beautiful sunny skies and the wind
        died down, giving us all a great opportunity to hang out and relax. Jay and John
        returned from their daytrip, without fish, but still glad they went. The late day
        activities included <a id="pic211Link" href="#" data-id="211">me posing for the camera</a>,

        Our last night in the park was spent sitting around the campfire trying to stay
        warm. The weather forecast NOAA recordings that I could pull in from my walkie-talkies
        suggested that overnight lows in the park could reach -2C overnight and would perhaps
        be the coldest night for us so far.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you recall earlier, I had bought a new sleeping bag for the trip, rated to +7C.
        Each night so far, I had been experimenting with different combinations to improve
        sleeping comfort. I think the worst of all of them was wearing my coat to bed (together
        with other T-shirt and sweatshirt layers) inside my sleeping bag. I think the rainproof
        coat did more to hold in moisture than heat, and I wound up sweating and then shivering.
    </p>
    <p>
        The last night may have been the coldest, but for me personally, it was the most
        comfortable. The best combination of layers I found over the three cold nights we
        were there was the method I used on the last night. I wore the same T-shirt and
        sweatshirt layers inside the sleeping bag, but then used my coat as a blanket on
        the outside of the sleeping bag. Lesson 1 - bring a better sleeping bag to account
        for weather that doesn't exactly follow the forecast. Lesson 2 - keep your coat
        outside your sleeping bag.

        The first pictures taken on Day 4 captured bright sun shining through the trees
        at 6:49 AM. Several of the guys said they thought the night before was definitely
        the coldest we had had so far. The fire was stoked to make some breakfast and the
        process of packing up was underway.

        This time, we opted for the shorter paddling route and would take the 765m portage
        from Timberwolf Lake into Misty Lake arriving there at 9:25 AM. We pushed on through
        Misty Lake to arrive at the 935m portage into Little Misty Lake at 10:41 AM. You
        can see the <a id="pic248Link" href="#" data-id="248">start of this portage</a>

        By 12:40 PM we had completed three portages (a distance of 2,150m). This brought
        us to the 450m portage from Petawawa River to Petawawa River, where we stopped and
        took a break for lunch.
    </p>
    <p>
        After lunch we finished the trip through the Petawawa River and another 130m portage
        and entered Daisy Lake. By this point, we were getting tired again, and Daisy Lake
        seemed the like the lake that would never end. We finally reached the 420m portage
        into the Pond from Daisy Lake around 3:40 PM.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once we skipped the 55m portage from the Pond into Hambone Lake, our pace seemed
        to pick up a bit, no doubt due to the pshychological lift that came with nearing
        the end of our trip. Tired and sore, I was looking forward to a shower, some junk
        food and a warm bed. We hit the last portage around 4:00 PM from Hambone Lake into
        Magnetawan Lake and by 4:25 PM we had finished that portage and made our way back
        to Access Point #3 where the journey started.

        That wrapped up another long travel day that included 8 hours of travelling, an
        approximate distance of 18.2km and a total of 2,840 metres portaged.

        With the cars mostly packed, the gang gathered at 5:07 PM for one last group photo
        before heading back home. The trip was a success. Nobody was injured or killed and
        I think everyone had a good time.
