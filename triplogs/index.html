            This trip log details my first canoe trip into Algonquin Provincial Park. My friend
            Jeff and I set out to conquer the park in our first adventure. In some ways the
            park conquered us, but it was a great time and I really enjoyed the experience.<br />

            For my second trip into the park, I chose a more relaxing route. It was supposed
            to be a holiday after all, so some rest and relaxation was in order. My fiance Jen
            and I retraced some of the steps from my previous canoe trip, but we opted to stay
            on Tom Thomson Lake for a couple of nights to increase the rest/relaxtion factor
            and reduce the crying, wimpering, paddling against the wind factor. After all, I
            am a computer programmer... my hands don't see alot of manual labour.<br />

            This was a good 3 night trip with a couple of friends. One canoe and one kayak.
            We had some awesome weather, and some great scenery. The trip log was written by
            Jeff and can be read on his website.<br />

            A challenging, early season trip into the back country. So early in fact, that the
            ice was off the lakes only a week before our trip. I went with a group of friends
            from Toronto. It was the first trip for some of them, and I imagine a bit of a rough
            introduction to back country camping for them, because the trip was a challlenge
            for me too, and I've been on a few others.<br />
