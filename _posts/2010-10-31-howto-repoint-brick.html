<p>I recently took on a new challenge, the restoration of a 145 year old century home.&nbsp; The house has triple brick walls and some of the restoration work we are doing includes repointing the lime based mortar.&nbsp; This involves manually taking the old mortar out and then replacing it with new mortar.</p>

<p>I took a 2 day workshop to learn how, and then I thought that making a How To video of the steps I am taking would be fun.&nbsp; So here it is!</p>
