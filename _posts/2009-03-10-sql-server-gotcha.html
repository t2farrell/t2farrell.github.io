<p>So I had a good fight today with a SQL Server 2008 connection that would not work.&nbsp; The error was:</p>
<h4>Cannot open database requested in login myDbName. Login fails. Login failed for user 'myDbUserName'</h4>

<p>&nbsp;This was dumbfounding.&nbsp; Troubleshooting the usual suspects, the following were attempted:</p>
<ul>
<li>check the database server to ensure that the database exists</li>
<li>check the user login to ensure it exists, check the permissions for the user for this database</li>
<li>try to connect using SQL Server authentication using this username and password from the Enterprise Manager - this works perfectly fine - but the ASP.NET application still gives this error</li>
<li>double, triple and quadruple check the connection string for the ASP.NET application - no problems found</li>
<li>drop the database and the login, recreate and try again - no difference</li>
<li>reboot the database server - no difference</li>
<li>check the event log for error messages - only the one displayed above is shown - nothing else out of the ordinary</li>
</ul>
<p>WTF?</p>
<p>I finally figured out, after a couple hours of head-scratching, from going through some event logs within SQL Server Enterprise Manager that the database name had 6 space characters appended to the name. Therefore what appeared in Enterprise manager and everywhere else as "myDbName" was actually "myDbName&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ".&nbsp; Something is obviously wrong with our MSBuild script which is autogenerating the database for us during the build process... I still have to figure out <strong><em>how </em></strong>it happened, but at least now I know <strong><em>why </em></strong>it would work in Enterprise Manager and not from the application.&nbsp; The app defines the connection string explicitly (with incorrect name missing spaces), while EntMgr connects and gives you a list of databases to choose from, so you never need to define the database name.</p>
<p>Once I renamed the database to remove the blank spaces, everything worked again.</p>
<p>I confirmed my theory by running this query, which highlights the extra spaces:</p>
<p><em>SELECT '"' + name + '"' FROM sys.databases</em></p>
<p>Ahhhh, the world makes sense again.</p>
