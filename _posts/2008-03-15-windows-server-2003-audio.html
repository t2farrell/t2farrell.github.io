<p>After setting up a new workstation at work with Windows Server 2003 x64 I discovered an annoying problem that was hard to live with and wound up being harder to solve than I expected.</p>

<p>For work, I often view alot of MSDN video and webcasts.&nbsp; The problem I was having was distorted audio during playback of these webcasts.&nbsp; Other MP3 or YouTube sources were problem free.&nbsp; The distorted audio was distracting and very annoying, but you could still hear the audio, which for these webcasts was typically just voice audio for the webcast presentation.&nbsp; Because the other audio sources were problem free, I initially thought that the audio for these webcasts was just poor quality, and I lived with it for a while, until I tested one at home, and found that the audio was perfectly fine at home.&nbsp; This caused me to investigate further, and for some reason finding a solution was much more difficult than I think it should have been.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe the patch had just been released at that point and not indexed by google yet, I'm not sure.&nbsp; I was very glad to find a fix though.</p>
<p>Anyway, the fix is available from Microsoft and cures a problem with audio that has been encoded using the Windows Media Audio Voice 9 codec, which was the case with many of the MSDN webcasts.</p>
<p>The fix can be found here:</p>
