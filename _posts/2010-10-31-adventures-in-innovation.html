<p>I recently had the opportunity to be an exhibitor at the Adventures In Innovation event held at Trent University in Peterborough on October 29, 2010.</p>

<p>The event was organized by the <a title="Workforce Development Board" href="http://www.wdb.ca/" target="_blank">Workforce Development Board</a> and the objectives of the event were to:</p>
<ul>
<li>educate local Grade 10 students about employment opportunities, educational requirements and "day to day" responsibilities of a variety of careers</li>
<li>assist students in making informed career choices</li>
</ul>
<p>Seeing as how we work in the field of Information Technology and more specifically, Software Development, we provided information about the types of employment positions that are typically found in that sector.</p>
<p>It was interesting to speak with some students who shared the same curious desire to take things apart and figure out how they worked, just as I did when I was their age.&nbsp; Several students expressed a genuine interest in building software.&nbsp; While some others, did a good job of faking it, in order to get one of our "spring" pens.&nbsp; The unique pens proved to be a good draw of traffic.</p>
<p>After a couple of hours, we had succeeded in speaking with several students, and I'd say the event was a success.</p>
<p>Here is a co-worker and I at our exhibitor booth.&nbsp; Unfortunately, our table had a bit of a sag in the middle which made things look a bit funny, but we persevered.</p>
