<p>After returning from PDC 2008, I've finally had a chance to process some video that I recorded of Scott Guthrie who participated in an Open Space meeting for about an hour.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I only recorded about 15 minutes of the action before my memory card filled up, but I guess that is better than nothing.</p>

<p>I did my best to clean up the audio, which had alot of ambient room noise.&nbsp; I wish it could be better, but I think it is clear enough now to be understandable, if not somewhat enjoyable.</p>
<p>The video is hosted on YouTube and due to time restrictions on uploaded video, the content is split into 2 parts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the first part,&nbsp; Scott talks about:</p>
<ul>
<li>ASP.NET and MVC Framework - the future of both and them co-existing with each other</li>
<li>Data Access - LINQ and the Entity Framework</li>
</ul>
<p>In the second part, he discusses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Functional Programming - programming WHAT you want done, versus the more typical HOW to do something, citing LINQ as a simple example</li>
<li>Moore's Law - gradually being replaced by new rules where the number of machine cores will begin doubling</li>
<li>Parallelism - efforts to make it easier for developers to take advantage of multiple cores through explicit APIs and implicitly through improvements to the CLR</li>
<li>F# and .NET 4.0</li>
<li>Dynamic Languages</li>
<li>WPF and Silverlight</li>
</ul>
