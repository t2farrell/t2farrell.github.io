<p>While doing some research for something I was working on, I came across this blog about ASP.NET and the Viewstate.&nbsp; This is a must read for those who are somewhat familiar with the viewstate and those who believe they know it all. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><a title="http://weblogs.asp.net/infinitiesloop/archive/2006/08/03/Truly-Understanding-Viewstate.aspx" href="http://weblogs.asp.net/infinitiesloop/archive/2006/08/03/Truly-Understanding-Viewstate.aspx" target="_blank">http://weblogs.asp.net/infinitiesloop/archive/2006/08/03/Truly-Understanding-Viewstate.aspx</a></p>
<p>The following are some points that I took away from the article:</p>
<ul>
<li>an ASP.NET control will automatically restore entered/selected values even if the ViewState is DISABLED!&nbsp; (wait, what? I thought that is what the ViewState was for?)</li>
<li>the Viewstate is typically only required for simple controls if the controls will be hidden between post backs (otherwise, see point above)</li>
<li>if you databind your control on each request in the OnInit event, you can disable the ViewState and the control will still automatically restore entered/selected values</li>
</ul>
