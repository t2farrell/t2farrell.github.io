A long while back, I created a list of technical conferences that might be of interest to those working with the Microsoft stack.  Since then, a lot has changed.  Microsoft has shuttered some conferences and adjusted others either in name or in definition.  My career path has opened up somewhat to include some other areas of development as well, not limited to strictly a Microsoft stack anymore.  I recently found myself doing some research to identify some of the options available for conferences these days and I figured it would be a good opportunity to gather the results of that research together into this list so it is all in one place.

Personally, I've been to a few of these in the past and I'll mention a few quick impressions:

## QCon San Francisco

A great conference, lots of skilled presenters representing some of the largest, well known companies.  Smaller than some of the Microsoft conferences, but that provides a more intimate feel and can make it easier to connect with people.

## FITC Web Unleashed

This is a good conference because it is one of the few I can attend in my area, helping to reduce travel costs.  The speakers have been getting better each year, offering a mix of local talent and some heavy hitters from afar.  Relatively small in size, the opportunity to network and socialize with peers is great.  The sessions are relatively short (~45 mins) meaning you don't get seriously in depth into any one topic.  You do get a quick overview that can be good to get you caught up on what is happening in the industry and provide lots of takeaways for later research and tinkering.

## Advanced Distributed Systems Design

Ok, this is not so much a conference, as it is a week long, intensive training course.  I attended in 2010 and I highly recommend this course.  It will challenge the way you think about software development and help to rethink and redefine many of the 'best practices' that you may have gotten used to.  This was a real eye opener for me and I am very glad that I attended.  The instructor, Udi Dahan, is an extremely effective teacher and while he is the author of NServiceBus and the founder of Particular Software, there is a lot of great knowledge to be gained from this that is technology agnostic.  If you work in the .NET stack and could benefit from trying NServiceBus, then even better, but I think the course could still be quite valuable to non-Microsofties as well.
